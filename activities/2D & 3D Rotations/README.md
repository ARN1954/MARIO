## 2D & 3D Rotations

## Questions based on 2D Rotations

Q.1. If A (2, 3) is rotated in the clockwise direction by 90 degrees, what are the coordinate values?

Q.2. If B (1, -2) is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by 60 degrees, what are the coordinate values?

## Questions based on 3D Rotations

Q.1. If A (5, 2, 6) is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by 180 degrees about the x-axis, what are the coordinate values?

Q.2. If B (1, 4, -3) is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by 180 degrees about the x-axis, and then in clockwise direction by 90 degrees in y-axis, what are the coordinate values?

## Hints

Refer the formulas for rotation matrices in 2D and 3D 

All the best !!!
