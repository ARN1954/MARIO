# Assignment Day 3

Q.1. Make axes according to the rules given in the DH-parameters for the following end-effectors and bots

Identify the joints and axes in the following bot

Your answer should specify the following parameters:

* Number of joints
* Degrees of freedom
* Types of Joints
* Name all the links starting from base link => search what is ground link
* **Transformation Matrix** from **base to link1 only** => take reference from the DH-parameterâ€™s PPT
* Bonus points if you define your own way of defining DH-parameters ðŸ˜‰

```
Note: The lower most link is immovable constraining the workspace of the bot in a single plane
```

Q.2. For the following Robotic arm diagram, Find the DH parameters and the final transformation matrix through Forward Kinematics.

Want a hint ?

`
â†’ revise ppt (Steps to calculate DH parameter and a particular equation in ppt)
`

Want more hints ?

`â†’ Ask your seniors :)`

All the best :-)
